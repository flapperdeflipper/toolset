# toolset

A bash library and toolset used for devops tasks and platform infrastructure on
mac osx.

This toolset is a set of tools, functions and libraries to make bash scripts a bit easier to
read, faster to develop and avoids some of the large pitfals that come with shell
scripting in bash.

It is a part of my dotfiles and configuration setup that I use for my personal and work computers,
by splitting this set and my dotfiles, which are private I want to reduce the complexity of my local setup
and hope that other people can make use of this set of tools.

I use it myself personally for both shell scripts and as the daily toolset by loading the
libraries in my environment through my `bashrc`.

I expect that some of the dependencies are not fully listed.

I'm open to merge requests for useful additions.


## Inspiration, sources

Many functions of this library have been seen in other libraries and adapted to
be used in this set of tools.

This set of utils was heavily inspired by
[libshell](https://github.com/legionus/libshell) and
[bashio](https://github.com/hassio-addons/bashio) and some functions and
libraries have been used in adapted form for use in this toolset.
